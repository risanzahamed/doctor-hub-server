A disproportionately large percentage of migrant deaths occur in areas where the predicted rates of water loss are highest,‚Äù says Ryan Long, an associate professor of wildlife sciences at the University of Idaho. Long also underlines the importance of access to drinking water supplies for preventing the risks at the highest rates of water loss during migration across the borders in the region."
